# How to create Jboss Node Setup.

Copy Jboss from Local System to /opt on Server.

Extrace the Jboss Server.

vim /opt/jboss-4.0.2.node1/bin/run.sh

Change the below parameter as per the node setup.

-Ddeploy.dir=/opt/wars/node1 -Dnode.id=1 -Djvm.route=node1 -Djvm.port=18009 -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m

Now goto /opt/wars/node1 directory. If directory is not there we need to create the same.

Take war and database configuration file from the Developers and copy the same on deployed directory.

Now start the jboss server.

cd /opt/jboss-4.0.2.node1/bin

./run.sh &

and check jboss server logs.

Logs are located in /opt/logs/node1/ directories.

tailf -f jbossserver.log  check there is any error or not.

If jboss start check with using telnet command.

telnet localhost 18009
