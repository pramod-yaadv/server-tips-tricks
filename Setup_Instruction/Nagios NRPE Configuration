Nagios NRPE Configuration

Nagios Remote Plugin Executor (NRPE), is used by nagios to run commands remotely on linux servers. We have to install NRPE in remote machince for Monitoring Clients.

How to install NRPE.

sudo yum install nrpe -y

How to start stop nrep service.

/etc/init.d/nrpe start | stop | restartow

Open "/etc/services" file make below entry and save it. 

vim /etc/services

nrpe            5666/nrpe                       #nrpe

Now open /etc/xinetd.d/nrpe and make changes like 

only_from       = 192.168.55.230 (Server IP)

Now Login to Nagios Server and Check NRPE configuration is working fine or not..?

How to Verify NRPE is working fine.

Go to

cd /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/

or where your Plugins are installed.

./check_nrpe -H Client_IP

For example in our envirnment.

cd /nagios/libexec

./check_nrpe -H 192.168.55.181

You wil get output like 

[root@nagios libexec]# ./check_nrpe -H 192.168.55.181
NRPE v2.12
[root@nagios libexec]#

Means NRPE is working properly means Nagios server is able to communicate with remote server.

Now again Login client or remote server.

In remote server for NRPE we have to make changes in /etc/nagios/nrpe.cfg file.

Now we have to configure remote server in Nagios Server. So we need to re-login Nagios Server.

How to configure remote server in Nagios.
First we have to configure NRPE command. So Open /nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg file and copy paste below syntex.

define command{
        command_name check_nrpe
        command_line $USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -t 30 -c $ARG1$
        }

Open Remote server cfg file and configure nrpe service after each changes of nrpe we have to reload Nagios server.
