# locate the process :

$ netstat -np

You get a source/destination ip:port portstate pid/processname map

# locate the the socket's file descriptor in the process

$ lsof -np $pid

You get a list: process name, pid, user,fileDescriptor, ... a connection string.

# Locate the matching fileDescriptor number for the connection. It'll be something like "97u" which means "97".

Now connect the process:

$ gdb -p $pid
Now close the socket:

# call close($fileDescriptor) //does not need ; at end.
example:

$ call close(97)

# Then detach gdb:
$ quit

And the socket is closed.
